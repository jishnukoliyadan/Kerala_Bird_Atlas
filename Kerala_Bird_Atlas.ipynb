    "The <font color='#F39C12'>Kerala Bird Atlas (KBA)</font>, the first-of-its-kind state-level bird atlas in India, has created solid baseline data about the distribution and abundance of various bird species across all major habitats giving an impetus for futuristic studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire state of Kerala was systematically surveyed twice a year during **2015‚Äì20**. It is arguably **Asia‚Äôs largest bird atlas** in terms of geographical extent, sampling effort and species coverage derived from the aggregation of 25,000 checklists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='#F39C12'>KBA</font> accounted for nearly three lakh records of `361` species, including `94` very rare species, `103` rare species, `110` common species, `44` very common species, and `10` most abundant species. \n",
    "\n",
    "## <font color='#D22CD3'>Objective</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Citizen-science driven exercises (e.g. bird surveys) and online platforms (e.g. [eBird](http://ebird.org/)) provide voluminous data on bird occurrence. However, the semi-structured nature of their data collection makes it difficult to compare bird distribution across space and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data on the distribution of species and the factors governing the same are prerequisites for effective and efficient conservation efforts. Such information is necessary to inform the selection of protected areas, to assess habitat associations and to predict the likely effects of future en-vironmental changes.\n",

    "Kerala lies between `8¬∞18'`N and `12¬∞48'`N lat. and `74¬∞52'`E and `77¬∞22'`E long. in southwestern India. Wedged between the Arabian Sea and the windward side of the Western Ghats, it receives abundant rainfall (`180‚Äì360` cm) and experiences a tropical climate. Elevation in the region varies from `‚Äì2.2` m (Kuttanad) to `2695` m (Anamudi peak). It is spread across an area of `38,863` sq. km, of which `27%` is under forest cover, `66%` is under cultivation and `7%` constitutes built-up areas/wetlands/uncultivated land. Onefourth of the Western Ghats range falls within Kerala. Surveys for <font color='#F39C12'>KBA</font> were conducted in all `14` administrative units (districts) of Kerala.\n",
    "### <font color='#2DD32C'>Sampling protocol</font>\n",
    "Kerala was divided into cells of size `3.75 min x 3.75 min` (equivalent to `6.6 km x 6.6 km`) aligned to Survey of India maps. A total of 915 cells were laid out covering the entire state. Each cell was further divided into four quadrants of size `3.3 km x 3.3 km`. Each quadrant was then sub-divided into `9` sub-cells of size `1.1 x 1.1 km`. A single, randomly selected sub-cell in every quadrant was chosen for the survey. Grids were laid and the randomly selected sub-cells were marked on the map prior to the survey. A total of `63` sub-cells were found to be located in inaccessible cliffs or valleys, and these were replaced by adjacent accessible sub-cells with the same habitat type from the same quadrants.\n",
